dinner.py is a solution to the age old problem of figuring out where to go for dinner. it utilizes a restaurant class that is stored in a list, which can be filtered, added to, or deleted from using prompts in the master loop.  the features i added in my project are:

1. implementing a master loop
2. create a class with multiple instances filled with data
3. populate and retrieve information from a list or dictionary
4. create 3 or more functions with at least one returning a value

to run the program, python will need to be installed, but it does not require any special packages. I am using the most recent version of python, however.
